## System Overview

The Mock Health Information Provider (HIP) system is designed to simulate a healthcare facility's integration with the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) ecosystem. This system implements all necessary APIs and workflows to interact with ABDM Gateway, handle patient data, manage consents, and facilitate health information exchange.

### Key Features
- Patient Discovery and Linking
- Care Context Management
- Consent Management
- Health Records Management
- ABDM Gateway Integration
- Security and Compliance

## Component Details

### 1. API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Route requests, handle authentication, manage API versions
- **Key Functions**:
  - Request routing
  - Rate limiting
  - Request/Response transformation
  - Security policy enforcement

### 2. Authentication Service
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant D as Database
    
    C->>G: Request with Token
    G->>A: Validate Token
    A->>D: Check Token Status
    D-->>A: Token Valid
    A-->>G: Authentication OK
    G->>C: Proceed with Request
```

### 3. Patient Service
- **Core Functions**:
  - Patient registration
  - ABHA verification
  - Care context management
  - Patient profile updates

### 4. Consent Service
```mermaid

    [*] --> REQUESTED
    REQUESTED --> GRANTED
    REQUESTED --> DENIED
    GRANTED --> EXPIRED
    GRANTED --> REVOKED
    EXPIRED --> [*]
    REVOKED --> [*]
    DENIED --> [*]
```

### 5. Health Records Service
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Health record storage
  - FHIR compliance
  - Data retrieval
  - Record linking

## Data Flows

### Patient Discovery Flow
```mermaid

    participant G as Gateway
    participant H as HIP
    participant P as Patient Service
    participant D as Database
    
    G->>H: Patient Discovery Request
    H->>P: Process Discovery
    P->>D: Search Patient
    D-->>P: Patient Details
    P-->>H: Patient Found/Not Found
    H->>G: Discovery Response
```

### Consent Management Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant G as Gateway
    participant H as HIP
    participant C as Consent Service
    participant HR as Health Records
    
    G->>H: Consent Notification
    H->>C: Process Consent
    C->>HR: Update Access Rights
    HR-->>C: Rights Updated
    C-->>H: Consent Processed
    H->>G: Acknowledgment
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid

    C -->|Yes| D[Process Request]
    C -->|No| E[Reject Request]
    D --> F[Service Layer]
    E --> G[Return 401]
```

### Data Security
1. **Encryption Layers**
   - In-transit encryption (TLS 1.3)
   - At-rest encryption (AES-256)
   - Field-level encryption for sensitive data

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access (RBAC)
